## üìÅ Repository Structure

### 1. Original Data Folder

This folder contains the main input datasets used throughout the analysis:

- **File 1: merged_normalized_ecological_and_wdi_wide.csv**  
  Combined environmental and socioeconomic data, used as the primary input file for all analyses in this study.

- **File 2: Supplementary Data and Sources.docx**  
  Provides detailed definitions, descriptions, and sources for each variable included in the merged dataset.

### 2. Code Folder

This folder includes all Jupyter Notebooks used:

- **File 1-HC.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook File (ipynb) for Hierarchical-Clustering**  

- **File 2-TSC_DTW.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook File (ipynb) for Time Series Cluster with Dynamic Time Warping (TSC-DTW)**  

- **File 3-MOO.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook File (ipynb) for Multi-objective Optimization (based on pymoo)**  

- **File 4-RMSE.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook File (ipynb) for Urbanization Rate Projections**  

- **File 5-Urb_Proj.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook File (ipynb) for Calculating Root Mean Square Errors for Urbanization Rate Projections**  

---

### 3. The Justice-Stratified Country Groups Output File Folder

This folder includes the resulting groupings of countries based on the applied methods:

- **File 1: the justice-stratified county group lists from the Hierarchical-Clustering**  
- **File 2: the justice-stratified county group lists from the Time Series Cluster with Dynamic Time Warping (TSC-DTW)**  
- **File 3: the justice-stratified county group lists from the Multi-objective Optimization (based on pymoo)**

Each file lists the resulting country groups formed under different methodological approaches, used in justice-based IAM scenario testing.

### 4.The Urbanization Projection Comparisons Folder

Contains RMSE results under various urbanization speed and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios:

- **4.1 FAST Urbanization Scenario**  
- **4.2 SLOW Urbanization Scenario**  
- **4.3 MODERATE Urbanization Scenario**  
- **4.4 SSP-4 Scenario**

Each subfolder contains the RMSE results comparing urbanization projections from Hierarchical Clustering, DTW Clustering, and MOO methods, as well as projections from Jian & O'Neill and Chen et al., against historical urbanization data from the World Bank.
